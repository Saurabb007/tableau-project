Pedestrian Accidents in Canada: Tableau Visualization

Overview

This repository contains a Tableau visualization project that analyzes pedestrian accidents in Canada. The visualization aims to provide insights into various aspects of these accidents, such as the locations with the highest frequency of accidents, the yearly trend of fatal and non-fatal accidents, the types of vehicles involved, the time of day when accidents are most frequent, and the impact of visibility on accidents.

Visualization Highlights

1. Accident Locations
Hotspots: Identifies areas with the highest concentration of pedestrian accidents.
Geographical Distribution: Provides a map view for easy identification of accident-prone areas.
2. Yearly Trends
Fatal vs Non-Fatal Accidents: Displays the number of fatal and non-fatal accidents for each year.
Trend Analysis: Helps in understanding the trend over the years, indicating whether accidents are increasing or decreasing.
3. Vehicle Types
Involved Vehicles: Shows the types of vehicles that are most frequently involved in pedestrian accidents.
Impact Analysis: Assesses which vehicle types pose the highest risk to pedestrians.
4. Time of Day
Accident Timing: Analyzes which parts of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) see the most pedestrian accidents.
Time-based Patterns: Helps in identifying specific time slots that are more accident-prone.
5. Visibility Conditions
Visibility Impact: Examines how different visibility conditions (clear, foggy, rainy, etc.) affect the occurrence of accidents.
Safety Insights: Provides insights into how poor visibility correlates with higher accident rates.
